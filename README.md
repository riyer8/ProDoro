# blueprint-project
(title open to edits)

## Motivation
The goal of this project was to get around a problem our group had all experienced, which is that there are many productivity tools, but rarely can you find them integrated in one place. Commonly used ones include pomodoro timers -- a timer which allots 15-25 minutes of time to work and a 5 minute break, todo lists, notepads, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript code editors for web app development.

## Plan
Our plan was to first create a bare-bones HTML webpage into which we would integrate separate aspects of our final vision. We then planned on refining the page with some CSS.

## Process
Things went more-or-less as planned, though HTML and CSS development were being done throughout the project.
