Commonly used ones include pomodoro timers -- a timer which allots 15-25 minutes of time to work and a 5 minute break, todo lists, notepads, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript code editors for web app development.

Our plan was to first create a bare-bones HTML webpage into which we would integrate separate aspects of our final vision. To add more design and animations, we refined the page with some CSS and Javascript.	Our plan was to first create a bare-bones HTML webpage into which we would integrate separate aspects of our final vision. We then planned on refining the page with some CSS.


## Process	## Process
Our team implemented various pages that contained key productivity tools using HTML, CSS, and Javscript. We carefully distributed the tasks among us in order to get as much of our idea implemented as possible.	Things went more-or-less as planned, though HTML and CSS development were being done throughout the project.

## Future Additions	
During the hackathon, our team came up with many ideas that weren't able to be implemented due to the lack of time.	
Here is a list of ideas that we would like to implement in the near future:	
 - Inspiration quotes for motivation	
 - A dashboard with all of the items on one page	
 - Various themes (light/dark mode)	
 - Refining and adding on the current applications
