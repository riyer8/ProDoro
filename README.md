## Motivation
The goal of this project was to get around a problem our group had all experienced: using a vast amount of productivity tools, but rarely finding them integrated in one place. This includes:
 - Pomodoro timers (a timer which allots 15-25 minutes of time to work and a 5 minute break)
 - To-do lists
 - Notepads
 - HTML/CSS/JavaScript code editors for Web App Development
 - Whiteboard for ideas

## Plan
Our plan was to first create a bare-bones HTML webpage into which we would integrate separate aspects of our final vision. To add more design and animations, we refined the page with some CSS and Javascript.

## Process
Things went more-or-less as planned, though HTML and CSS development were being done throughout the project.

## Future Additions
During the hackathon, our team came up with many ideas that weren't able to be implemented due to the lack of time.
Here is a list of ideas that we would like to implement in the near future:
 - Inspiration quotes for motivation
 - A dashboard with all of the items on one page
 - Various themes (light/dark mode)
 - Refining and adding on the current applications
