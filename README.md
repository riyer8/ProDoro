# ProDoro

## Motivation
The goal of this project was to get around a problem our group had all experienced: using a vast amount of productivity tools, but rarely finding them integrated in one place. This includes:
 - Pomodoro timers (a timer which allots 15-25 minutes of time to work and a 5 minute break)	
 - To-do lists	
 - Notepads	
 - HTML/CSS/JavaScript code editors for Web App Development	
 - Whiteboard for ideas	


## Plan
Our plan was to first create a bare-bones HTML webpage into which we would integrate separate aspects of our final vision. To add more design and animations, we refined the page with some CSS and Javascript.	


## Process
Our team implemented various pages that contained key productivity tools using HTML, CSS, and Javscript. We carefully distributed the tasks among us in order to get as much of our idea implemented as possible.

## Future Additions	
During the hackathon, our team came up with many ideas that weren't able to be implemented due to the lack of time.	
Here is a list of ideas that we would like to implement in the near future:	
 - Inspiration quotes for motivation	
 - A dashboard with all of the items on one page	
 - Various themes (light/dark mode)	
 - Refining and adding on the current applications
